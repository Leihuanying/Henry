Hello! My name is Leihuanying. I am a student at No. 2 Experimental School.  

I love learning and am especially passionate about computers. I enjoy exploring technology, solving problems, and improving my skills in programming or other computer-related fields.  

In my free time, I like to reading books about computers. Iâ€™m always excited to learn new things and connect with others who share my interests!  

Nice to meet you!
